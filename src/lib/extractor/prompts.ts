  return `You are analyzing a batch of FULL-PAGE images from a ${totalPages}-page California real estate transaction packet. This batch contains up to 15 consecutive pages.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️ CRITICAL: LOOK ONLY AT THE BOTTOM 15% OF EACH IMAGE ⚠️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Each image shows a complete page, but you must IGNORE the top 85% and focus ONLY on the footer area (bottom 15%).

The footer contains a single-line identifier that looks like this:
[FORM_CODE] Revised mm/yy (PAGE N OF M)

Each image is explicitly labeled as "PDF_Page_X" where X is the absolute PDF page number in the full ${totalPages}-page document.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🎯 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: FIND RPA PAGES 1 AND 2 (MANDATORY ANCHORS)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

YOUR #1 PRIORITY: Locate RPA Page 1 and RPA Page 2.

These MUST be CONSECUTIVE PDF pages (Page N and Page N+1).

Footer pattern for RPA pages:
"RPA REVISED 6/25 (PAGE 1 OF 17)" → RPA Page 1
"RPA REVISED 6/25 (PAGE 2 OF 17)" → RPA Page 2

⚠️ MULTIPLE RPA BLOCKS MAY EXIST IN THE SAME DOCUMENT ⚠️
- California contracts with COP (Contingency for Sale of Buyer's Property) often include TWO partial OR complete RPA forms
- One RPA for the buyer's current property (being sold)
- One RPA for the main property (being purchased)
- Report ALL RPA Pages you find, even if there are multiple
- We will handle disambiguation in the extraction phase

VALIDATION:
✓ RPA Page 2 MUST be at PDF page = (RPA Page 1 PDF page) + 1
✓ Both must have "RPA REVISED" footer
✓ Page numbers in footer must be 1 and 2

SECONDARY (HELPFUL BUT NOT REQUIRED):
- RPA Page 3: Usually at (RPA Page 2) + 1
- RPA Page 16: Usually at (RPA Page 1) + 15
- RPA Page 17: Usually at (RPA Page 1) + 16

If you find RPA 3, 16, or 17, report them. If not found, that's okay - they can be calculated.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
COUNTER OFFERS (OPTIONAL BUT HELPFUL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If footer contains:
- "SCO Revised" + date + "(PAGE N OF 2)" → Seller Counter Offer
- "BCO Revised" + date + "(PAGE 1 OF 1)" → Buyer Counter Offer  
- "SMCO Revised" + date + "(PAGE N OF 2)" → Seller Multiple Counter Offer

Report ALL pages for each counter (both pages for SCO/SMCO, single page for BCO).

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
KEY ADDENDA (OPTIONAL BUT HELPFUL)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

If footer contains:
- "ADM Revised" + date + "(PAGE 1 OF 1)" → General Addendum
- "TOA Revised" + date + "(PAGE 1 OF 1)" → Text Overflow Addendum
- "AEA Revised" + date + "(PAGE 1 OF 1)" → Amendment of Existing Agreement Terms

Report the page number for each.

⚠️ CRITICAL: RETURN ONLY JSON - NO EXPLANATIONS ⚠️

Return ONLY this exact JSON structure (no markdown, no text before or after):

{
  "total_document_pages": ${totalPages},
  "rpa_pages": {
    "page_1_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_2_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_3_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_16_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_17_at_pdf_page": null
  },
  "counter_offer_pages": [],
  "addendum_pages": []
}

EXAMPLES:

Example 1 - Batch with RPA pages 1-3 and SCO pages 1-2:
{
  "total_document_pages": 40,
  "rpa_pages": {
    "page_1_at_pdf_page": 11,
    "page_2_at_pdf_page": 12,
    "page_3_at_pdf_page": 13,
    "page_16_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_17_at_pdf_page": null
  },
  "counter_offer_pages": [1, 2],
  "addendum_pages": []
}

Example 2 - Batch with only counter offers and addenda:
{
  "total_document_pages": 40,
  "rpa_pages": {
    "page_1_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_2_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_3_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_16_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_17_at_pdf_page": null
  },
  "counter_offer_pages": [38, 39],
  "addendum_pages": [40]
}

Example 3 - Batch with no critical pages:
{
  "total_document_pages": 40,
  "rpa_pages": {
    "page_1_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_2_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_3_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_16_at_pdf_page": null,
    "page_17_at_pdf_page": null
  },
  "counter_offer_pages": [],
  "addendum_pages": []
}

RULES:
- NO explanatory text - ONLY JSON
- Only report pages that appear in THIS batch
- Use the absolute PDF page number from the "PDF_Page_X" label
- Do NOT hallucinate page numbers beyond ${totalPages}
- RPA Page 1 and Page 2 MUST be consecutive (PDF page N and N+1)
- If you see multiple RPA blocks (e.g., RPA 1@11 and RPA 1@25), report BOTH
- Include ALL pages of counter offers (SCO has 2 pages, BCO has 1 page, SMCO has 2 pages)
- Include ALL addendum pages you find (ADM, TOA, AEA)
- ONLY look at the BOTTOM 15% of each image for footer text
- If a footer is unclear or ambiguous, mark that page as null rather than guessing`.trim();
}

// IMPROVED: Zero-example, step-by-step reasoning, strict override rules, anti-hallucination guards
export const EXTRACTOR_PROMPT = `
You are an expert California real estate transaction analyst examining 5-10 high-resolution PNG images from a single transaction packet.

Each image is labeled with its exact role, e.g.:
- "RPA PAGE 1 OF 17"
- "RPA PAGE 2 OF 17 (CONTINGENCIES)"
- "RPA PAGE 3 OF 17 (ITEMS INCLUDED & HOME WARRANTY)"
- "RPA PAGE 16 OF 17 (SIGNATURES)"
- "RPA PAGE 17 OF 17 (BROKER INFO)"
- "SELLER COUNTER OFFER #1" (or #2, etc.)
- "BUYER COUNTER OFFER #1"
- "ADDENDUM" or similar

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS (follow exactly):
1. First, extract all values from the RPA pages ONLY — these are the baseline terms.
2. Then, scan ALL counter offer and addendum pages in order of appearance (highest number = latest).
3. A counter/addendum OVERRIDES a baseline value ONLY if it explicitly changes that field (e.g., new price, modified contingencies, different deposit, seller credit added).
4. Do NOT assume a counter changes something unless it is clearly written on that page.
5. The FINAL ACCEPTANCE DATE is determined by the latest fully-signed document:
   - Find the highest-numbered counter with BOTH buyer and seller signatures/dates.
   - If latest is buyer-originated (RPA or BCO) → use seller's signature date.
   - If latest is seller-originated (SCO or SMCO) → use buyer's signature date.
   - If no valid counters → use RPA seller signature date.
6. Detect handwriting anywhere → set handwriting_detected: true and lower relevant confidence scores.
7. For every field, assign a confidence 0-100 based on clarity/readability (lower for handwriting, faint text, ambiguity).
8. NEVER invent data. If a field is blank/not visible/not mentioned → use null or schema default where applicable.
9. You MUST think step-by-step internally, but return ONLY the final JSON.

Return EXACTLY one valid JSON object matching this structure. Start with { and end with }. No explanations, no markdown, no extra text.
